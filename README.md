# calendar
This is my first front-end project made according to Directual LEARNING project.
Task was to create calendar, design was made Apple-like


v1.1:

    added change between month and year view, 
    added functions to work with local storage,
    styles now are in different files,
    sidebar, topbar, content head and views are rendering automatically 
      
      
    known bugs: 
    bound on month view changes it position
    mini calendar state changes
    month view looks awful
    next and previous buttons in the view segment are working incorrectly
